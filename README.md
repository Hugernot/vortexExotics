This website is being developed for my friend's startup business, Vortex Exotics, although he may change it later- it's unknown. This is also mainly being developed so that I can get experience. This project is on GitHub so I can share it, my friend whom I'm developing this for can see it in progress, and just because GitHub is darn useful.

Comments, pointers, anything are loved and welcome, I'm REALLY new to this. There's probably a million and one things that I'm doing wrong.
